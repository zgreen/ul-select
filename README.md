ul-select
=========

Make an unordered list behave like a select element

## THIS PLUGIN IS DEPRECATED AND IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED.

Feel free to use it if you like, but there are [better options available](https://select2.org/).

## Use

1. Load jQuery.
2. Load the ul-select.css, or complile the Sass partial.
3. Call `ulSelect()` on the unordered list that you want to render as a select element.
